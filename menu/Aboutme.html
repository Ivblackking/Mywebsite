                        My name is Ivan. I am 21 years old. At school, he was interested in programming,<br>
                        mathematics and physics. It was then that he learned the C++ programming language<br>
                        and participated in physics Olympiads. Then he also studied C, C#, Python.<br>
                        Now I have already graduated from the Bachelor of Physics Faculty<br>
                        of Taras Shevchenko Kyiv National University. I want to constantly raise my level<br>
                        in programming, as well as start working on real industrial tasks and projects.<br>
                        Programming is also my passion. I like to learn new programming languages ​​and to code in general.<br>
                        I recently started learning web development. I am also fond of playing chess.<br>
                        You can visit me on the website chess.com by my username ivlysen.<br>
